# IT Risk & Opportunity Analysis

**For small professional services firms** — accounting, law, consulting, and similar practices with 5–10 people who need to protect client data, avoid downtime, and spend less time on technology and more on billable work.

## What This Is

This analysis gives you a **clear picture in plain numbers**:

1. **What’s at risk** — The main IT risks for firms like yours (ransomware, data breaches, downtime, compliance gaps) and what they could cost your business each year if left unaddressed.
2. **Where the value is** — A prioritized list of technology improvements: which ones save you the most money, reduce risk the most, and are quickest to implement.

No technical expertise required. The outputs are built for decision-makers who want to understand risk and return in business terms.

## Why It Matters for Your Firm

- **Protect client data and your reputation** — See which risks threaten confidentiality and how recommended solutions address them.
- **Reduce lost billable hours** — Understand the cost of IT problems and which investments give the best return.
- **Support compliance** — Align with professional and regulatory expectations (e.g. Law Society, CPA, PIPEDA) without wading through jargon.
- **Plan with confidence** — Know what to do first, what can wait, and what “good enough” looks like for a firm your size.

## What You Get

- **[Risk register](fair_risk_register.ipynb)** — Each risk is described in plain language with an estimated annual cost of exposure, so you can see the price of inaction.
- **[Opportunity matrix](it_opportunity_matrix.ipynb)** — Each recommended solution is scored by value (savings, productivity, risk reduction) and implementation effort, so you can choose quick wins and longer-term investments.
- **Charts and summaries** — Visual summaries (in the notebooks above) of where your risk sits and how much value each solution can deliver.

The analysis uses industry-standard frameworks ([FAIR](FAIR.md) for risk quantification, [CIS Controls](CIS.md) for security best practices) so the numbers and recommendations are grounded in established methods, not guesswork.
